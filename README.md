Predicting natural disasters

I will like to work on the tsunami travel time prediction using artificial neural networks.The technique which I am thinking to  compute travel times over the study domain is to apply Huygens principle which states that all points on a wave‚Äêfront are point sources for secondary spherical waves. From the epicentre location travel time can be calculated to equidistant grid points.The grid point with minimum time is taken as the new starting point and calculation can be performed again to all surrounding points.

The input to the artificial neural network model will comprise the location of the underwater earthquake source( latitude and longitude )and the Expected time of arrival from the comprehensive database.Artificial neural network will aim to  computes a new travel time chart which is time efficient prediction of Expected time arrival to several coastal destinations in the Indian Ocean given any epicenter location in the domain.Once the time is found coastal areas can be warned accordingly.
